# figma_2_fluttertest

Testing of the FigmaToFlutter Plugin.


## Test 1: Generating Code for Login (Basic Rectangles & Text)

The goal of this test is to see what basic shapes that this plugin can generate.
So far it can do the following:
    - Create a Container with correct layout & constraints
    - Good formatting Code
    - Can switch code between stateful & stateless
Cons:
    - The button must be programmed individually
    - It provides a good start for the UI, however, will need a front-end
      designer/coder to finish off the rest of the features.
